ECHO is on.


This landscape opens into a wide, peaceful valley framed by rolling green mountains that rise gently toward the sky. Sunlight washes over the grassy fields, bringing out rich shades of green that make the scene feel fresh and alive. Soft clouds drift lazily above the peaks, adding depth and calm to the open horizon. The untouched land and quiet surroundings create a sense of freedom and serenity, as if nature is inviting you to pause, breathe, and enjoy its simple beauty.
